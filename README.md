How to use

  This project is working on the authentication process by OAuth2 with the Smartthings platform.
  To use this project, you must provide the recover id on your smartapp:
        
        private static String CLIENT_ID = "YOUR-CLIENT_ID";
        // Use your own client id
        private static String CLIENT_SECRET ="YOUR-CLIENT_SECRET";
        // Use your own client secret

  After the application runs all by itself to recover the Token (valid about 50 years), the Uri and Url of EndPoint.

  This project poc√®de two examples of communication with a Smartapp:

    - Recover data
        GetDevices jParser = new GetDevices();
        JSONObject jsonDevices = jParser.getDevices(uriRequest,token,path);
    - Send data (and receive the answer that everything is well spent)
        SendParameter jParser = new SendParameter();
        JSONObject jsonDevices = jParser.sendParameter(uriRequest,token,path);  

  Attention, always use it's command, as shown in the project, assynchronously
